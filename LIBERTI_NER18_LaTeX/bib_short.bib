              in freely behaving animals is becoming a standard method to study
              neural circuit function. Flexible, open-source designs are needed
              to spur evolution of the method. APPROACH: We describe a
              miniature microscope for single-photon fluorescence imaging in
              freely behaving animals. The device is made from 3D printed parts
              and off-the-shelf components. These microscopes weigh less than
              1.8 g, can be configured to image a variety of fluorophores, and
              can be used wirelessly or in conjunction with active commutators.
              Microscope control software, based in Swift for macOS, provides
              low-latency image processing capabilities for closed-loop, or
              BMI, experiments. MAIN RESULTS: Miniature microscopes were
              deployed in the songbird premotor region HVC (used as a proper
              name), in singing zebra finches. Individual neurons yield
              temporally precise patterns of calcium activity that are
              consistent over repeated renditions of song. Several cells were
              tracked over timescales of weeks and months, providing an
              opportunity to study learning related changes in HVC.
              SIGNIFICANCE: 3D printed miniature microscopes, composed
              completely of consumer grade components, are a cost-effective,
              modular option for head-mounting imaging. These easily

              be probed during behaviors that engage the circuits. Linking
              circuit dynamics to behavior requires precise control of sensory
              stimuli and measurement of body movements. Head-fixation has been
              used for behavioral research, particularly in non-human primates,
              to facilitate precise stimulus control, behavioral monitoring and
              neural recording. However, choice-based, perceptual decision
              tasks by head-fixed mice have only recently been introduced.
              Training mice relies on motivating mice using water restriction.
              Here we describe procedures for head-fixation, water restriction
              and behavioral training for head-fixed mice, with a focus on
              active, whisker-based tactile behaviors. In these experiments
              mice had restricted access to water (typically 1 ml/day). After
              ten days of water restriction, body weight stabilized at
              approximately 80\% of initial weight. At that point mice were
              trained to discriminate sensory stimuli using operant
              conditioning. Head-fixed mice reported stimuli by licking in
              go/no-go tasks and also using a forced choice paradigm using a
              dual lickport. In some cases mice learned to discriminate sensory
              stimuli in a few trials within the first behavioral session.
              Delay epochs lasting a second or more were used to separate
              sensation (e.g. tactile exploration) and action (i.e. licking).
              Mice performed a variety of perceptual decision tasks with high
              performance for hundreds of trials per behavioral session. Up to
              four months of continuous water restriction showed no adverse
              health effects. Behavioral performance correlated with the degree
              of water restriction, supporting the importance of controlling
              access to water. These behavioral paradigms can be combined with

              to their potential for direct neuroprosthetic applications for
              amputees and disabled individuals. Supporting this promise,
              animals-including humans-can learn even arbitrary mapping between
              the activity of cortical neurons and movement of prosthetic
              devices [1-4]. However, the performance of neuroprosthetic device
              control has been nowhere near that of limb control in healthy
              individuals, presenting a dire need to improve the performance.
              One potential limitation is the fact that previous work has not
              distinguished diverse cell types in the neocortex, even though
              different cell types possess distinct functions in cortical
              computations [5-7] and likely distinct capacities to control
              brain-computer interfaces. Here, we made a first step in
              addressing this issue by tracking the plastic changes of three
              major types of cortical inhibitory neurons (INs) during a
              neuron-pair operant conditioning task using two-photon imaging of

              performance with all subtypes, but the strategies were subtype
              specific. When parvalbumin (PV)-expressing INs were targeted, the
              activity of N- decreased. However, targeting of somatostatin
              (SOM)- and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP)-expressing INs led
              to an increase of the N+ activity. These results demonstrate that
              INs can be individually modulated in a subtype-specific manner
              and highlight the versatility of neural circuits in adapting to
              new demands by using cell-type-specific strategies.",

  abstract = "BACKGROUND: Motion correction is a challenging pre-processing
              problem that arises early in the analysis pipeline of calcium
              imaging data sequences. The motion artifacts in two-photon
              microscopy recordings can be non-rigid, arising from the finite
              time of raster scanning and non-uniform deformations of the brain
              medium. NEW METHOD: We introduce an algorithm for fast Non-Rigid
              Motion Correction (NoRMCorre) based on template matching.
              NoRMCorre operates by splitting the field of view (FOV) into
              overlapping spatial patches along all directions. The patches are
              registered at a sub-pixel resolution for rigid translation
              against a regularly updated template. The estimated alignments
              are subsequently up-sampled to create a smooth motion field for
              each frame that can efficiently approximate non-rigid artifacts
              in a piecewise-rigid manner. EXISTING METHODS: Existing
              approaches either do not scale well in terms of computational
              performance or are targeted to non-rigid artifacts arising just
              from the finite speed of raster scanning, and thus cannot correct
              for non-rigid motion observable in datasets from a large FOV.
              RESULTS: NoRMCorre can be run in an online mode resulting in
              comparable to or even faster than real time motion registration
              of streaming data. We evaluate its performance with simple yet
              intuitive metrics and compare against other non-rigid
              registration methods on simulated data and in vivo two-photon
              calcium imaging datasets. Open source Matlab and Python code is
              also made available. CONCLUSIONS: The proposed method and
              accompanying code can be useful for solving large scale image
              registration problems in calcium imaging, especially in the
              presence of non-rigid deformations.",

              plasticity in corticostriatal circuits has been implicated in

              and temporal scales? While a complete mechanistic account of this
              process remains elusive, evidence suggests that neuronal
              oscillations may play a key role in this process, with different
              rhythms influencing both local computation and long-range

              single unit and local field potential (LFP) activity from
              microelectrode arrays implanted bilaterally in macaque motor
              areas. Monkeys performed a delayed center-out reach task either
              manually using their natural arm (Manual Control, MC) or under
              direct neural control through a brain-machine interface (Brain
              Control, BC). In accord with prior work, we found that the
              spiking activity of individual neurons is coupled to multiple
              aspects of the ongoing motor beta rhythm (10-45 Hz) during both
              MC and BC, with neurons exhibiting a diversity of coupling
              preferences. However, here we show that for identified single
              neurons, this beta-to-rate mapping can change in a reversible and
              task-dependent way. For example, as beta power increases, a given

              BC, or exhibit a reversible shift in the preferred phase of
              firing. The within-task stability of coupling, combined with the
              reversible cross-task changes in coupling, suggest that
              task-dependent changes in the beta-to-rate mapping play a role in
              the transient functional reorganization of neural ensembles. We

              hundreds of layer 2/3 neurons while mice learned a forelimb

              whereas excitatory neuron activity showed higher dynamism during
              the initial phase of learning. The dynamics of excitatory neurons
              during the initial phase involved the expansion of the
              movement-related population which explored various activity
              patterns even during similar movements. This was followed by a
              refinement into a smaller population exhibiting reproducible

              decreasing activity during movement. Individual cells changed
              their activity across days, which led to changed associations
              between corticospinal activity and movement. Unlike previous
              observations in layer 2/3, activity accompanying learned
              movements did not become more consistent with learning; instead,
              the activity of dissimilar movements became more decorrelated.
              These results indicate that the relationship between
              corticospinal activity and movement is dynamic and that the types
              of activity and plasticity are different from and possibly
              complementary to those in layer 2/3.",

              between sensory stimuli and behavioral actions. However, it is
              poorly understood whether representations for learned
              associations stabilize in cortical association areas or continue
              to change following learning. We tracked the activity of
              posterior parietal cortex neurons for a month as mice stably
              performed a virtual-navigation task. The relationship between
              cells' activity and task features was mostly stable on single
              days but underwent major reorganization over weeks. The neurons
              informative about task features (trial type and maze locations)
              changed across days. Despite changes in individual cells, the
              population activity had statistically similar properties each day
              and stable information for over a week. As mice learned
              additional associations, new activity patterns emerged in the
              neurons used for existing representations without greatly
              affecting the rate of change of these representations. We propose
              that dynamic neuronal activity patterns could balance plasticity

              extracting the activity of each neuron from raw fluorescence
              calcium imaging data is a nontrivial problem. We present a fast
              online active set method to solve this sparse non-negative
              deconvolution problem. Importantly, the algorithm 3progresses
              through each time series sequentially from beginning to end, thus
              enabling real-time online estimation of neural activity during
              the imaging session. Our algorithm is a generalization of the
              pool adjacent violators algorithm (PAVA) for isotonic regression

              remarkable increases in processing speed: more than one order of

              solvers relying on interior point methods. Unlike these

              the quality of activity inference by imposing a constraint on the

  author   = "Neely, Ryan and others",
  abstract = "Animals acquire behaviors through instrumental conditioning.
              Brain-machine interfaces have used instrumental conditioning to
              reinforce patterns of neural activity directly, especially in
              frontal and motor cortices, which are a rich source of signals
              for voluntary action. However, evidence suggests that activity in
              primary sensory cortices may also reflect internally driven
              processes, instead of purely encoding antecedent stimuli. Here,
              we show that rats and mice can learn to produce arbitrary
              patterns of neural activity in their primary visual cortex to
              control an auditory cursor and obtain reward. Furthermore,
              learning was prevented when neurons in the dorsomedial striatum
              (DMS), which receives input from visual cortex, were
              optogenetically inhibited, but not during inhibition of nearby
              neurons in the dorsolateral striatum. After learning, DMS
              inhibition did not affect production of the rewarded patterns.
              These data demonstrate that cortico-basal ganglia circuits play a
              general role in learning to produce cortical activity that leads
              to desirable outcomes.",
